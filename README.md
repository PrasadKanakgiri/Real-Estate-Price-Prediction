# Real-Estate-Price-Prediction
This data science project series walks through step by step process of how to build a real estate price prediction website. We will first build a model using sklearn and linear regression using banglore home prices dataset from kaggle.com. Second step would be to write a python flask server that uses the saved model to serve http requests.
